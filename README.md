# Employee Database

# Background:

Research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

Design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, perform **data modeling**, **data engineering**, and **data analysis**.

## Objectives:

1. Data Modeling:

Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. 

2. Data Engineering

Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

3. Data Analysis
